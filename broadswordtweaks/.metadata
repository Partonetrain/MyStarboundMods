  "description" : "A few tweaks to broadswords:\n-The angle of broadswordcombo is 10 degrees lower, allowing you to hit enemies slightly below you (my biggest peeve with broadswords)\n-The Firestorm's Fury (flamingdemonsword) now uses the broadswordcombo just like every other broadsword\n-The Soulseeker is now two-handed (why is it one-handed in the first place?), uses broadswordcombo, now has the Parry alt ability, and inflicts the otherwise-unused 'crash' effect.\n\n!!This mod replaces rocketspear.lua, flamingdemonsword.animation, soulseeker.animation, and is probably incompatible with anything that causes broadswords to be aimable!! Every other change is a patch and should be compatible.\n\nv2 adds support for the Project: Ancient Cosmos upgraded versions of these weapons",
