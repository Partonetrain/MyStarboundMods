  "description" : "This mod does the following: \n-Replaces the food gender icons in the character creator with the standard gender icons\n-Fully renames Calliskii to Calskies (always plural). The base mod uses both names interchangably which I didn't care for.\n-Adjusts Callistan subspecies FU stats and biome bonuses. The subspecies get bonuses from the biomes you'd expect.\n-Makes Callistan weapons use FU tooltips. Armor is unchanged.\n-Alters some callistan object descriptions. Adds cat/veluu/neko object descriptions.",
