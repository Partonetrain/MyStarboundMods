  "description" : "Makes small, medium, and large fossil pools roughly equal in chance. In vanilla, the chances are 40% for a small fossil, 35% for a piece medium fossil, and 20% for a piece of a small fossil. With this mod, the chances are 34% small, 33% medium, and 33% large. Hopefully this helps with the \"all fossils\" achievement. You will still have to combine 3 medium or 5 large fossils, so those are still necessarily harder. Yes, it's compatible with FU.",
