  "description" : "Re-arranges recipes (and some treasurepools) in several mods (and vanilla) in accordance with Starburst Rework's progression, particularly replacing Solarium with Chronium. Generally only progression-related things are changed, things like furniture aren't. Supported mods (and changes):\n-Vanilla (mech body recipes, common.treasurepools ore pool)\n-Project Ancient Cosmos (recipes)\n-Boss Loot Bags (treasure pools)\n-Pocket Dimensions (quests and recipe) \n-More Mech Drill Tiers (recipes, item names & art)\n-Transfiguration Gun (recipe)\n-Mechs are made of ARMOR (recipe)\n-Super City Pack (EPP quest text - removes mention of EPPs having previous tier resistances)\n\nFeel free to suggest (non-FU) mods in the comments, no promises though",
