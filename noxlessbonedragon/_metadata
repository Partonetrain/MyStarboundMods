  "description" : "Very simple sprite edit that removes Asra Nox from the Bone Dragon. I always thought she looked a bit odd being completely static up there, and some mod I have adds Bone Dragons in missions outside of missions, so it makes more sense if she just isn't riding it. It's not *exactly* how it looked in the Alpha (so the thumbnail is a little misleading), but it's close. This mod is priority 1000 so hopefully it loads after any other mods that touch this sprite",
