  "description" : "Makes the Vintage Scoped Rifle (the vanilla item obtained by the second arena quest The Glory That's Inside) into a hunting weapon. It's obviously supposed to be a hunting rifle, and its id is 'hunterrifle' for chrissakes, but it doesn't act as a hunting weapon in vanilla. v3 removes the \"standardbulletbow\" projectile and makes it use the vanilla \"huntingbullet\" projectile, but this works identically. Should be compatible with everything.",
