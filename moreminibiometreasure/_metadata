  "description" : "In vanilla Starbound, chests in surface and underground mini biomes have exclusive treasure pools that are chosen only 30% of the time in each of the 2-4 rolls in each chest. (Normal biomes have 50% normal treasure and 50% biome treasure in 1-5 rolls).\nThis effectively means you will need to visit many of the same mini-biome to obtain every exclusive item, which is pretty boring.\nThis mod simply sets the weight of the exclusive treasure pools to the same as the basic treasure pool just like how it is for normal biomes, ideally increasing the amount of biome-exclusive loot in each chest and decreasing the amount of times you have to visit different planets looking for the same mini-biome. \nIn testing, this resulted in biome chests tending to give 2-3 exclusive items as opposed to them tending to give 1 in vanilla.\n!!This mod assumes a VANILLA biome.treasurepools, if you have mods that patch this file it's probably fine but it's possible to get different results!!\n\nAffected biomes:\nSurface: Mushroom, Spring, Oasis, Tar, Colourful, Bone, Alpine, Bio Luminescent, Giant Flower, Swamp, Eyeball, Ice (Tundra), Steam Spring, Prism, Hive, Foundry, Geode\nUndergound: Underground Mushroom, Underground Wilderness, Underground Tar, Underground Bone, Underground Ice Cave, Underground Stone Cave, Underground Luminous, Underground Flesh, Underground Cell, Underground Slime",
